            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are one main repository for all project files. Team members can check files out, update them, and check them back in. Version control systems automatically note who changed files, when files were changed, what about the files is new or different, and merges changes to the same file. Benefits of version control systems include: files cannot be overwritten, there is a common repository that hold all files, multiple users can work on the same files simultaneously without issue, you can revert back to older versions of projects/files if need be, and the system backs up files so you never lose them.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle all projects with efficiency and speed. Git has a tiny footprint with super fast performance.  Git is a distributed version control system. This means that every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their device, everything is local, there is no single point of failure, processes run much faster, and git even prevents an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. Basic Git commands include: git init, git add, git commit, git log, and git status. Remote commands include: git remote, git pull, and git push. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Many people choose to copy files into another directory as their version-control method. People choose to do this because it is very easy, but errors are easily encountered too. It’s easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file. Dealing with this issue is how local VCSs came to be. Another issue people encounter is that they need to work along with their team of developers on other systems. In order to manage this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems were created. These systems have a single server that contains all of the versioned files and multiple clients that check out files from there. However, even CVCSs have their issues, which include a single point of failure resulting in possible complete data loss.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to deal with the possibility of complete data loss from CVCSs, Distributed Version Control Systems were created. In a DVCS clients fully mirror the repository. This means that if a server dies, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Many of these systems deal well with having more than one remote repositories that they can work with, so it’s possible to work with different groups of people in more than one way simultaneously within the same project. This allows the user to set up multiple types of workflows that aren’t possible in CVCSs.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In Git, there are three main file stages: committed, modified, and staged. The committed stage is where data is safely stored in the local database. The modified stage is where you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. And finally, the staged stage is where you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. There are also three Git sections: the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. The working stage is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Gir directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify. Lastly, the final stage is the staging area, which is a file, generally in Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. </p>
